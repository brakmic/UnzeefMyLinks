In **2014** I had created several Development Link-Collections targeting popular JavaScript frameworks (Backbone, Angular, Ractive) and languages (Rust).

Sadly, the people from Zeef misused my pages by adding **commercial link-blocks** (headhunting companies, job-search engines etc.) without informing me in the first place.

I've contacted them several times to make it clear that I neither endorse nor want anyone to manipulate my pages without my consent.

And especially I don't want to have anything commercial on my link-pages. 

I've collected all those links to **help** the Developer community!

We all know how hard it can be to learn JavaScript and the gazillion of different `technologies` so these link-pages were created to support JavaScript enthusiasts.

Some time ago Zeef responded with apologies and even offered me to participate in this `advertising scheme` but I refused. 

I've built all those pages without any commercial plans in mind and I'd never ever accept any money that's not coming from my employer. 

I'm sure that I'm not the only one who continuosly receives emails with offers to `write a book on JavaScript` or `advertise a new video-course on XYZ-Technology` and the like.

But **all of my code** on GitHub and my [blog](http://blog.brakmic.com) posts are completely free. I do not need an additional `money supply`.

Of course, I understand that companies have certain commercial interests and that's perfectly fine. But they should be open in articulating their plans and communicate better with people who build up pages, posts and write code for others **for free**.
